## Why do we need the Privacy Sandbox?

The Privacy Sandbox initiative has two core aims:
* Develop replacement solutions to support web use cases and business models without enabling users 
to be tracked across sites, and avoiding cross-site tracking users aren't aware of.
* Phase out support for third-party cookies when new solutions are in place.
