  First Input Delay (FID) is an important, user-centric metric for measuring
  [load responsiveness](/user-centric-performance-metrics/#types-of-metrics)
  because it quantifies the experience users feel when trying to interact with

The First Input Delay (FID) metric helps measure your user's first impression of
